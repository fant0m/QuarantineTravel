    <string name="about1">Quarantine Travel was developed as challenge \"can full-stack web developer make a game\"? Before the challenge I had zero knowledge of Kotlin and almost no knowledge of Android platform. There wouldn\'t be such motivation without Kiwi\'s mobile challenge, so big thank you!</string>
    <string name="about2">Game falls into \"quiz\" category. It has many different types of questions, which are focused on (air) travelling. The data comes from Kiwi.com API. Each player has 5 lives in 1 game round. The goal of the game is to gain the highest score. Players can compare their results with everyone across the globe!</string>
