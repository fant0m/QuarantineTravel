# Abstract
Quarantine Travel was developed as challenge "can a full-stack (javascript) web developer (who likes travelling and knows everything from GDS to fuel dumping) make an Android game"? Before the challenge I had zero knowledge of Kotlin and almost no knowledge of Android platform. There wouldn't be such motivation without Kiwi's mobile challenge, so thank you!

Game falls into "quiz" category. It has 6 different types of questions, which are focused on (air) travelling. The data comes from Kiwi.com public API. Each player has 5 lives. Wrong answer causes 1 life, except the bonus questions where you might even earn more points! Each game round has 10 seconds timer so you need to be fast too! The goal of the game is to gain the highest score. Players can compare their results with everyone across the globe!
